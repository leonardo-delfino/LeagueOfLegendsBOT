# League of Legends insta-locker

Links:
* \

A champion can be:
* banned
* over picked

Flow:
* Check if the client is running
* Check if the game has been accepted (or create a function to accept a game)
* Pick the champion
* Ban that garbage called Samira (so I need another priority list)
* Check if my champion has not been banned or over picked (if so, delete the entry from the priority list)
* Insta-lock it
* Maybe a function that detects my runes based on the champion?
  
Data structures:
* Priority list with the champions I want to pick.
* Priority list with the champions I want to ban.
